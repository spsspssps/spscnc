# Description
This is the repository for KiCad_BOM_Wizard. This KiCad plugin can be used to create custom BOM files based on easy configurable templates files. The plugin is writing in JavaScript and has been designed to integrate into KiCadâ€™s BOM plugin manager.

The Idea for this plugin came from our need to generate BOM that are specific to of our clients needs. for example, some of our clients require their product to have document traceability due to their product ATEX certificate requirement.
With KiCad_BOM_Wizard, We simply made a template that the output file includes the document number, project revision, and manufacture notes.

By default, KiCad_BOM_Wizard comes with two templates, one will generate a stand along HTML file and the other will generate a CSV file.
They are both include to simplify the use of plugin and can be used as an example by those who want to make their own templates. The latter could be due to needing to have your own company or project logo.

KiCad_BOM_Wizard works by scanning through all of the template files and replacing any of the Short Codes with the data that is associated with it. It will then output all of the data it has collected including the file structure
into one file based on the order that it finds the short codes.

For example, if the KiCad_BOM_Wizard finds the short code <!--TAG_TITLE--> in template.conf then it we replace it with the KiCad project root sheet title. KiCad_BOM_Wizard will also group and sort all components together that have same parts value, the same starting designator reference prefix and the same fields value.

For example, if your project component list consist of;
> R1 10K, R2 100K, C1 10pF and R3 10K

then it would be grouped like this;

> | Ref | qty | value |
> |----|-----|-----|
> |C1 | 1 | 10pF |
> | R1 R3 | 2 | 10K|
> | R2| 1 | 100K|

# Installation
## nodeJs
```The following serves as a quick reference.```

```
##### Mac OSX using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install node
```
##### Installing nodejs on other systems:
[NodeJS.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Installation KiCad_BOM_Wizard via npm (prefer method)
```bash
npm install -g --production kicad_bom_wizard
```

# Using KiCad_BOM_Wizard
Kicad BOM Plugin Manager Command Line:

#### MAC OSX Note!
```bash
there have been reports that `node` wont run in KiCad BOM generator unless its full path has been specified.
If you have this issues, try replacing `node` with `PATH_TO_NODE/node` where PATH_TO_NODE is your system absolute path to node.

- It might this: `/usr/local/bin/node`
```
Here's where it was first repoted: [kiCad.info](https://forum.kicad.info/t/kicad-bom-wizard-plugin-with-customisable-output-can-make-html-and-csv-bom/2142/7?u=opticalworm)

#### For HTML BOM
```
kicad_bom_wizard "%I" "%O.html"
```

This is the same as
```
kicad_bom_wizard "%I" "%O.html" "HTML"
```
This is the same as
```
kicad_bom_wizard "%I" "%O.html" "SCRIPT_ROOT_DIR/Template/HTML"
```

#### For CSV BOM
```
kicad_bom_wizard "%I" "%O.csv" "CSV"
```

This is the same as
```
kicad_bom_wizard "%I" "%O.csv" "SCRIPT_ROOT_DIR/Template/CSV"
```

#### Using your own template BOM

```
kicad_bom_wizard "%I" "%O.html" "Path_To_Your_Template_conf/Your_Template"
```

Or if you are using the plugin template directory to store your template. "SCRIPT_ROOT_DIR/Template/"

```
kicad_bom_wizard "%I" "%O.html" "Your_Template"
```

- ***Where "%I" in the input kicad xml file and "%O" is the output directory and name for the BOM. This must include your file extension.***
- ***If you are using the script directly and not by npm install, then you will need to replace ```kicad_bom_wizard``` with  ```node "SCRIPT_ROOT_DIR/KiCad_BOM_Wizard.js"```.***
- ***You may have to replace ```node``` with ```nodejs```***

# Notes for Contributing
If you find issues with the code that you want to contribute a fix for or even just wanting to improve the project there are a few things you need to do before you submit your pull request or patch.

- Make sure that you run the install command to make sure hat you have all the tools to test this project.

`num install`

- run the Lint: this project uses javascript [standard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard) pacakge to ensure a consistent coding style is maintained. before submitting your code make sure that you run the lint command and fix any error that it highlights.

`npm run lint`

- Run the test: This will both check if the program runs and also regenerate the Meter.csv and Meter.html files. You should also check these files for any obvious issues.

`npm run test`
